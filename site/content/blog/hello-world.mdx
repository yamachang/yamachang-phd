Welcome to my research blog. Here I'll share ongoing research notes, reflections from conferences, and longer pieces about the intersection of AI and mental health.

## What to expect

- **Research updates** — short notes on ongoing projects and preliminary findings
- **Long-form explainers** — deeper dives into why AI needs clinical psychologists, and vice versa
- **Conference reflections** — key takeaways from academic conferences and workshops

Stay tuned for more.
